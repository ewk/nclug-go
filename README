Less is More
An introduction to Go
Eddie Kovsky

Go is a new general purpose programming language. It is one of the more
mature entries among the many new languages that have emerged recently
for systems programming. Go was designed from scratch to take advantage
of modern hardware while avoiding some of the pitfalls of previous C
like languages. This introductory talk will highlight some of the
design choices and features of Go that make it powerful and unique.
